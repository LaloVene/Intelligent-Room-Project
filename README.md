# Intelligent-Room-Project

Won first place in the Campus Engineering Expo by developing a mobile app which can be used to control a roomÂ´s light, fan, doors and windows in combination with a NodeMCU board. The app also connects to an API to get the current weather and use it to predict if it is going to rain using a Deep Learning model. I used Ionic, Firebase, Keras, ChartJS and TensorFlowJS.
